# Progress Tracker

Cross-session status for the ZAMN native-port project. Update this whenever a
milestone lands. See `PLAN.md` for the full multi-phase plan.

## Current status: **Phase 2 in progress** 🔨 (2026-07-23)

Compression, graphics **and level layout** are decoded as port code. The LZSS
decompressor and the level tilemap builder are both **verified byte-exact
against the ROM's own routines** — the level check diffs the full expanded map
(18,304 tiles), the block library, the row tables, the scalars, the tile
attributes and both palettes. All 56 levels decode and render. Sprites/actors
and music remain.

**Phase 1 complete** (2026-07-23) — analysis toolchain built in-tree; the frame
skeleton and a first WRAM map documented from traced execution.

**Phase 0 complete** (2026-07-22) — native Windows build of the game running
through a vendored SNES core, headless + interactive.

## Environment (verified)
- **Toolchain:** VS2022 Community — MSVC 14.43 (`cl` 19.43), CMake 3.30.5 & Ninja
  1.12.1 (both bundled with VS), Python 3.13. None are on PATH by default; the
  build sources `vcvars64.bat` (see `tools/build.ps1`). Use `powershell`, not
  `pwsh` — PowerShell 7 is not installed.
- **ROM:** `Zombies Ate My Neighbors.sfc` — LoROM, 8 Mbit (1,048,576 B), no
  coprocessor, no SRAM (password saves), NTSC. RESET=$80AE, NMI=$816C.

## What exists now

### Phase 0 — runtime
- `third_party/lakesnes/` — vendored LakeSnes SNES core (MIT), SDL-free. Serves
  as both the reference emulator and the emulated PPU/APU going forward.
- `third_party/stb/stb_image_write.h` — PNG writer for headless frame dumps.
- `src/headless.c` → **`zamn_headless.exe`** — boots ROM, runs N frames, dumps a
  512×480 PNG.
- `src/main_sdl.c` → **`zamn.exe`** — interactive window + keyboard + audio.
  SDL2 is fetched & built from source by CMake (pinned `release-2.30.9`).

### Phase 1 — analysis
- `src/analysis/` — shared library: 65816 instruction table (`w65816.c`), CDL
  format + LoROM address mapping (`cdl.c`), input movies (`movie.c`). The Phase 3
  co-simulation harness reuses all three.
- `src/trace.c` → **`zamn_trace.exe`** — steps the core one instruction at a time
  with scripted input and emits a CDL, WRAM/register maps, a call graph, a DMA
  log, and loop-collapsed instruction traces. The core is **not** modified.
- `src/disasm.c` → **`zamn_disasm.exe`** — CDL-driven annotated 65816 listing.
- `movies/boot.zmv`, `movies/level1.zmv` — reproducible input scripts;
  `level1.zmv` reaches actual gameplay (verified by `--png` frame dump).
- `tools/symbols/zamn.sym` — evidence-backed symbol names.
- `docs/analysis-tools.md`, `docs/frame-skeleton.md`, `docs/wram-map.md`.

### Phase 2 — assets
- `src/assets/` — **port code, not tooling**: it ships in the finished game, so
  it depends on nothing but libc. `lzss.c` (a byte-exact port of `$80:CD20`),
  `gfx.c` (planar tiles + BGR555 palettes), `rom.c` (LoROM address mapping),
  `level.c` (the level record, block-library decompression and tilemap
  expansion — a port of the loader at `$80:86A2`).
- `src/assets.c` → **`zamn_assets.exe`** — decodes ROM data to `.bin`/`.png`,
  and `verify-lzss` / `verify-level` diff the C decoders against the ROM's own
  routines under the reference core. `level <n> [out.png]` reports and renders
  any of the 56 levels.
- `docs/asset-formats.md` — the LZSS stream layout, the tile/palette encoding,
  the full level format (record table, block library, expansion), and how each
  decoder was checked.

## Verification done
- Phase 0: headless dumps at frames 500/800/1200 render correctly (verified
  visually). `zamn.exe` played and confirmed by hand.
- Phase 1: `movies/level1.zmv` reaches in-game level 1 — confirmed by the
  tracer's own final-frame PNG (HUD, Zeke, a victim, a chainsaw maniac on
  screen). Trace findings cross-check each other: the DMA log's OAM source
  ($7E:13BE, 544 B → $2104) matches the WRAM region report's 562-byte
  write-only buffer at the same address, and the LZSS ring buffer inferred from
  `$80:CD20` matches the 4096-byte region at `$7E:6F00`.
- Phase 2: `verify-lzss` intercepts all 5 decompression calls `level1.zmv`
  reaches and finds the C port byte-identical to `$80:CD20` — output, byte
  count, *and* the final 4 KB window. Confirmed non-vacuous: flipping one bit of
  the C output makes all 5 fail and the tool exit non-zero. Tile and palette
  decoding is an eyeball check against sources named in `dma_log.csv` — the
  hardware encoding has no ROM routine to diff against — and both a compressed
  and an uncompressed source render as legible glyphs.
- Phase 2 (level): `verify-level` lets the game load level 1 (record `$9F:9060`,
  table entry 2) and diffs 15 things against the WRAM `$80:86A2` just built — all
  pass, including the **entire 18,304-tile expanded map** in bank `$7F`, the
  32 KB block library, the two row-base tables, the derived scroll scalars, the
  1 KB tile-attribute table and both 256-byte palettes. All 56 levels decode via
  `zamn_assets level` with no errors, and maps from every tileset group render as
  coherent art (the map *values* are what `verify-level` proves exactly).

## Key findings (Phase 1)
- **ZAMN runs a 24-slot cooperative thread scheduler with per-thread stacks**
  (`thread_yield` at `$80:8353`, the most-called routine in the game). The main
  loop is a `WAI` inside it. **This is the single biggest input to Phase 3** —
  game logic suspends mid-routine, so a plain C function cannot replace a
  routine one-for-one. See `docs/frame-skeleton.md` → *Porting consequences*.
- All code runs from the `$80-$BF` FastROM mirror; direct page is pinned at
  `$0000` for the whole game; the IRQ vector is never taken.
- NMI does: frame counter → re-entrancy guard → force blank → VRAM upload queue →
  vblank job queue A → unblank → joypad read → job queue B → return.
- Graphics reach VRAM through exactly one choke point (the queue at `$7E:1B84`
  drained by `$80:9E7B`) — the natural seam for Phase 5's renderer.
- Compression is 4K-window **LZSS** (`$80:CD20`, ring buffer at `$7E:6F00`),
  consistent with what Necrofy documents.
- CDL coverage from one boot-to-level-1 movie: **18.3%** of ROM (13,767 bytes of
  code, 177,817 of data, 182 subroutines, 362 call edges).

## Next steps — Phase 2 (asset pipeline)
1. ~~Confirm our LZSS implementation against `$80:CD20` byte-for-byte.~~ ✅
2. ~~Tile and palette decoding, cross-checked against `dma_log.csv`.~~ ✅
3. ~~**Level layout** — record table at `$9F:8000`, block library, tilemap
   expansion. Ported (`src/assets/level.c`) and verified byte-exact against
   `$80:86A2` by `verify-level`; all 56 levels decode.~~ ✅
4. **Sprite/actor definitions**, then music/sequence data. Identify the actor
   slot tables flagged in `docs/wram-map.md` (the `$100`-stride array at
   `$7E:0300`+ and the 20-byte-stride table at `$7E:1872`+). The unidentified
   `$9F`-internal pointers in each level record (`+$1C`/`+$1E`/`+$20`) are the
   likely home of the per-level actor placements — the way in.
5. Extend `movies/` — password screen, level transition, a boss, two-player — to
   push CDL coverage up; every report regenerates automatically, and each new
   movie widens the `verify-lzss`/`verify-level` coverage for free.

## Known limitations / TODO (deferred, non-blocking)
- Frame pacing fixed 2026-07-22: paced by sync-to-audio, with a monotonic-timer
  fallback when no audio device (`src/main_sdl.c`).
- No gamepad mapping yet (keyboard only). No save states / config yet.
- `analysis/` and `build/` are scratch (git-ignored). `analysis/` in particular
  contains verbatim ROM bytes and must never be committed.
- Windows-only by design for now (per project scope).
