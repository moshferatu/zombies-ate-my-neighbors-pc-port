// the carry bug above. It would be easy to treat a yield as "the routine is not
// finished, so there is nothing to check yet" — but the state at the `JSL
// thread_yield` is handed straight to `PHP`, parked with the thread, and given
// back by `PLP` when it resumes. Anything wrong there is wrong for the rest of
// the routine, and in native mode nothing else would ever set it. So a
// suspension declares its registers and flags exactly as a return does.
//
// `in` is captured per *segment* — at the routine's entry, and again at each
// resumption — so "unchanged" here means unchanged across this run of the
// routine's own instructions, not across the suspension. That is the claim the
// routine's listing can actually support, and it is the one that survives Phase
// 4 replacing the scheduler underneath it.
//
//   * Neither X nor Y is mentioned anywhere in `$80:891A-$80:8932`, so both come
//     back as the segment found them.
//   * At a suspension, `LDA #$0001` is the last instruction before the `JSL`:
//     A is the sleep count, and N and Z describe it.
//   * Carry at a suspension depends on **which** suspension, and this is the one
//     thing here that is not obvious from reading the routine top to bottom. The
//     loop reaches the `JSL` by falling through `CMP #$000F`, which borrows for
//     every brightness below 15 and so leaves carry clear. The *first*
//     suspension is entered from the top of the routine and never executes that
//     `CMP` at all, so it carries the caller's own carry through untouched.
//     Fifteen of the sixteen segments agree with the simple answer, which is
//     exactly why it is worth getting right rather than guessing.
//   * At the return, `LDA $136C : CMP #$000F` is the tail: A is $000F, and 15
//     minus 15 is zero with no borrow, so N=0, Z=1, C=1. Nothing between that

// more often than not. What is left is the depth sort's spill on passes that
// draw nothing, which would need that routine to model its own walk in WRAM.
